KINDLE Review Sentiment Analysis

Project Overview : 

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Kindle reviews, predicting the sentiment of each review using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Gaussian Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm. The input to the model is the textual content of Kindle reviews, and the output is the predicted rating (0 or 1) wherein rating >= 3 is positive (1) and rating < 3 is negative (0).

Key Features : 

Sentiment Analysis: Analyze customer reviews to predict the sentiment based on the review content.
Gaussian Naive Bayes: A supervised learning algorithm for classification tasks, applied here to predict the review rating.
Text Preprocessing: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and feature extraction using Bag of Words and TF-IDF.
Data: Uses a dataset of Kindle reviews with review text and corresponding ratings.

Technologies Used : 

Python: Main programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and vectorization.
NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing and tokenization.
Matplotlib: For visualizations (if applicable).
Jupyter Notebooks: For easy exploration and documentation of code.
